# README: vehicles_insight
This repository could be used to extract certain information from the "vehicles" dataframe, showing it in console. The information could be:
- Shape of dataframe.
- Number of rows.
- Column's name.
- Column's type.
- Amount of Null values per column.
- Minimun and maximun value of every column.

You just need to follow the instructions and ask for the data you need. I hope it will be useful!
